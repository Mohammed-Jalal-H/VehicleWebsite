            <span>How to increase the Fuel ?<br><br><br></span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Smooth Driving: Avoid aggressive driving behaviors such as rapid acceleration and hard braking. Smooth driving can help conserve fuel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Maintain a Steady Speed: Use cruise control when driving on highways to maintain a constant speed, which can help optimize fuel consumption.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Regular Vehicle Maintenance: Follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule for your vehicle. This includes regular oil changes, air filter replacements, and tune-ups. A well-maintained vehicle operates more efficiently and consumes less fuel.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Proper Tire Maintenance: Keep your tires properly inflated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Under-inflated tires can increase rolling resistance, which leads to decreased fuel efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Remove Excess Weight: Remove unnecessary items from your vehicle, especially if you're carrying heavy loads. Extra weight requires more fuel to move the vehicle, so keeping the vehicle light can improve fuel efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Plan Your Trips: Combine multiple errands into one trip to minimize driving distance and time spent on the road. Planning your routes efficiently can help reduce fuel consumption.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Use Aerodynamic Accessories: Minimize drag on your vehicle by removing roof racks or cargo carriers when they're not in use. These accessories can increase wind resistance and decrease fuel efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Avoid Excessive Idling: Turn off your engine if you anticipate being stationary for more than a minute. Idling wastes fuel and contributes to unnecessary emissions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Choose the Right Fuel: Use the type of fuel recommended by your vehicle's manufacturer. Using premium fuel in a vehicle that doesn't require it typically doesn't provide any additional benefits and can be a waste of money.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            <p>Drive Less: Whenever possible, consider alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, carpooling, or using public transit. Reducing the number of miles you drive overall can significantly decrease fuel consumption and emissions.</p>
